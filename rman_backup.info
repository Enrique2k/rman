<<FAQ
#------------------------------------------------------------------
Q1. How do I schedule backups?
A1. Add following entries into crontab (e.g. crontab -e):
		 At least 2 cron entries are required to take DB backup
		 and archive log backups (FULL+ARCH),
		 or 3 records in manual scheduling mode (FULL+INCR+ARCH).
	Also, schedule XCHK crontab entry to run crosschecks and reports.
Q2. How do I add passwords to Oracle Wallet?
A2. mkstore -wrl $TNS_ADMIN -createCredential TNSname username password
	See complete setup description in ORACLEWALLET section below.
    Oracle 10g and 11g wallets aren't compatible. Create one per OH.
Q3. Which entries I should add to Oracle Wallet?
A3. Add at least RMAN catalog user (if using RMAN catalog).
    In DG setup, also add system's password of the other node.
Q4. Which version of Oracle has Oracle Wallet functionality.
A4. Versions of Oracle 10g and up come with support of OW.

# *** Best practices **********************************************
<<BESTPRACTICES
#------------------------------------------------------------------
 1. Make sure you have at least 45 days of control files retention period (even if using rman catalog):
	ALTER SYSTEM SET CONTROL_FILE_RECORD_KEEP_TIME=45 SCOPE=BOTH;  
	Precise formula: CONTROL_FILE_RECORD_KEEP_TIME = retention period + level 0 backup interval + 1 (per 397269.1 Note).
 2.1. FRA must be configured. Script assumes its extistence on 10g+ databases.
 2.2. In 10g+ don't specify LOG_ARCHIVE_DEST_x destination explicitly, instead use USE_DB_RECOVERY_FILE_DEST:
      e.g. LOG_ARCHIVE_DEST_1='LOCATION=USE_DB_RECOVERY_FILE_DEST'
   otherwise Oracle will not consider archive logs as FRA-managed and will not clean them under space pressure.
      (For details check 829755.1) This is especially important on DG - we don't run arch log backups on primary db.
 3. If using custom archive_log_format, always include %s,%t and %r (read http://goo.gl/7RUPTQ for details).
 4. Always use spfiles, so init parameters can be backed up automatically.
 5. $BASE_PATH should be in a separate filesystem from old of your Oracle Homes.

# *** Complete Oracle Wallet setup steps **************************
<<ORACLEWALLET
#------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Create a private sqlnet.ora for oracle user ~/.sqlnet.ora (change /home/oracle to a real path):
	$ cat >> $TNS_ADMIN/sqlnet.ora <<EOHD
#== Oracle Wallet Configuratiob below == do no remove this and following lines
WALLET_LOCATION =
   (SOURCE=(METHOD=FILE)(METHOD_DATA=(DIRECTORY=$TNS_ADMIN)))
SQLNET.WALLET_OVERRIDE = TRUE
SSL_CLIENT_AUTHENTICATION = FALSE
SSL_VERSION = 0
#== 
EOHD

2. Create the Wallet:
	$ mkstore -create -wrl $TNS_ADMIN
	It will ask for a new Oracle Wallet password twice - make sure you'll keep it in a secure place.

3. Add as many TNS entries into Oracle Wallet as needed.
3.1. RMAN Catalog password (if you're using catalog), e.g. 
	$ mkstore -wrl $TNS_ADMIN -createCredential rmanc rman11 Password
		where rmanc - TNS name that will be used by this script and referred in cataloguid variable above,
			  rman11 - rman catalog user, and Password - is password of this user.
3.2. If using Data Guard - add also following two entries
	$ mkstore -wrl $TNS_ADMIN -createCredential TnsThisNode sys SysPassword
	$ mkstore -wrl $TNS_ADMIN -createCredential TnsOtherNode sys SysPassword
		where TnsOtherNode - TNS name (from tnsnames.ora) that will be to connect to the other node
				in DG setup to do ARCHIVE LOG CURRENT there,
			make sure to use user SYS and not SYSTEM for TnsThisNode.

4. Try that Oracle Wallet setup is complete:
	$ sqlplus /@rmanc   or   $ sqlplus /@TnsOtherNode
		in both cases it should not ask you for a password and you should be able to login to database.
