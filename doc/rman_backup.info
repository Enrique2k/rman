# *** Frequently Asked Questions **********************************
<<FAQ
#------------------------------------------------------------------
Q1. How do I schedule backups?
A1. Add following entries into crontab (e.g. crontab -e):
		 At least 2 cron entries are required to take DB backup
		 and archive log backups (FULL+ARCH),
		 or 3 records in manual scheduling mode (FULL+INCR+ARCH).
	Also, schedule (e.g. weekly/monthly) XCHK crontab entry to run 
	crosschecks and RMAN health reports.
Q2. How do I add passwords to Oracle Wallet?
A2. mkstore -wrl $TNS_ADMIN -createCredential TNSname username password
	See complete setup description in ORACLEWALLET section below.
    Oracle 10g and 11g wallets aren't compatible. Create one per OH.
Q3. Which entries I should add to Oracle Wallet?
A3. Add at least RMAN catalog user (if using RMAN catalog).
    In DG setup, also add SYS's password of local node's database 
	and ones on other nodes. For example,
	mkstore -wrl $TNS_ADMIN -createCredential rmanc rmanuser password1
	mkstore -wrl $TNS_ADMIN -createCredential TNSa sys password2
	mkstore -wrl $TNS_ADMIN -createCredential TNSb sys password3
	, where TNSa=SIDa of the local database instance, and TNSb=SIDb 
	of the remote (Data Guard) database.
Q4. Which version of Oracle has Oracle Wallet functionality.
A4. Versions of Oracle 10g and up come with support of OW.
	Oracle 9i may be used with Wallet Manager (http://goo.gl/i3GcwY ), or 
	probably with orapki utility (not tested).

# *** Best practices **********************************************
<<BESTPRACTICES
#------------------------------------------------------------------
 1. Make sure you have at least 45 days of control files retention period (even if using rman catalog):
	ALTER SYSTEM SET CONTROL_FILE_RECORD_KEEP_TIME=45 SCOPE=BOTH;  
	Precise formula: CONTROL_FILE_RECORD_KEEP_TIME = retention period
						+ level 0 backup interval + 1 (per 397269.1 Note).
 2.1. FRA must be configured. Script assumes its existence on 10g+ databases.
 2.2. In 10g+ don't specify LOG_ARCHIVE_DEST_x destination explicitly, instead use USE_DB_RECOVERY_FILE_DEST:
      e.g. LOG_ARCHIVE_DEST_1='LOCATION=USE_DB_RECOVERY_FILE_DEST'
   otherwise Oracle will not consider archive logs as FRA-managed and will not clean them under space pressure.
      (For details check 829755.1) This is especially important on DG - we don't run arch log backups on primary db.
 3. If using custom archive_log_format, always include %s,%t and %r (read http://goo.gl/7RUPTQ for details).
 4. Always use spfiles, so init parameters can be backed up automatically.
 5. $BASE_PATH should be in a separate filesystem from all of your Oracle Homes.
 6. Oracle 10g Data Guard should have _LOG_DELETION_POLICY='ALL' per 728053.1 Note. 11g+ does this automatically.

# *** Complete Oracle Wallet setup steps **************************
<<ORACLEWALLET
#------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Adjust sqlnet.ora in $TNS_ADMIN/sqlnet.ora (you should use separate OW for each OH):
	$ cat >> ${TNS_ADMIN:-${ORACLE_HOME}/network/admin}/sqlnet.ora <<EOHD
#== Oracle Wallet Configuratiob below == do no remove this and following lines
WALLET_LOCATION =
   (SOURCE=(METHOD=FILE)(METHOD_DATA=(DIRECTORY=${TNS_ADMIN:-${ORACLE_HOME}/network/admin})))
SQLNET.WALLET_OVERRIDE = TRUE
SSL_CLIENT_AUTHENTICATION = FALSE
SSL_VERSION = 0
#== 
EOHD

2. Create the Wallet:
	$ mkstore -create -wrl ${TNS_ADMIN:-${ORACLE_HOME}/network/admin}
	It will ask for a new Oracle Wallet password twice - make sure you'll keep it in a secure place.

3. Add as many TNS entries into Oracle Wallet as needed.
3.1. RMAN Catalog password (if you're using catalog), e.g. 
	$ mkstore -wrl ${TNS_ADMIN:-${ORACLE_HOME}/network/admin} -createCredential rmanc rman11 Password
		where rmanc - TNS name that will be used by this script and referred in cataloguid variable above,
			  rman11 - rman catalog user, and Password - is password of this user.
3.2. If using Data Guard - add also following two entries
	$ mkstore -wrl ${TNS_ADMIN:-${ORACLE_HOME}/network/admin} -createCredential TnsThisNode sys SysPassword
	$ mkstore -wrl ${TNS_ADMIN:-${ORACLE_HOME}/network/admin} -createCredential TnsOtherNode sys SysPassword
		where TnsOtherNode - TNS name (from tnsnames.ora) that will be to connect to the other node
				in DG setup to do ARCHIVE LOG CURRENT there,
			make sure to use user SYS and not SYSTEM for TnsThisNode.

4. Try that Oracle Wallet setup is complete:
	$ sqlplus /@rmanc   or   $ sqlplus /@TnsOtherNode
		in both cases it should not ask you for a password and you should be able to login to database.
		
5.1. Oracle Wallet files can be copied over to another servers. This is especially useful
   in case of running RMAN in a cluster. So you can create a wallet on one node and copy
   over to the rest of a cluster. E.g.:
	$ scp ?wallet.* anothernode:`pwd`
5.2. If you see this as a security risk, then Oracle Wallet can be created without ability 
   to be used on other servers. Use orapki command then instead of mkstore:
	$ orapki wallet create -wallet ${TNS_ADMIN:-${ORACLE_HOME}/network/admin} -pwd "walletpwd" -auto_login_local
